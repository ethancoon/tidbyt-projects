# Simple Clock

This simple clock app tells the time, with a two-frame animation. The start of every hour (4:00, 12:00) will be denoted by a different text color than normal. The top icon will change depending on the time of day, where if it is after sunrise a sun image will be displayed, while if it is after sunset a moon image will be displayed.
